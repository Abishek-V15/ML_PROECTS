# ML_PROECTS
This mini project includes Regression, Classification and Clustering Algorithms and models.

ANALYSIS FOR RETAIL, HOUSE GRADING AND CLUSTERING 

These projects utilize various machine learning techniques in various domains. The first project predicts store sales through regression analysis, enabling store owners to strategize and set realistic goals. Data cleaning and preprocessing methods are applied for accurate results. The second project builds a classification model for house grades, aiding real estate companies in categorizing houses based on condition. Similarly, data cleaning and preprocessing ensure reliable outcomes. Additionally, clustering models are developed to group similar stores or houses, employing comprehensive data preprocessing. These projects leverage data-driven insights to enhance decision-making, optimize sales strategies, and improve customer experiences.


Thank you.
